# Running Hell
Grab the loot! Dodge the demons! Run like hell!

# Huh? What?
Running Hell is a doom mod about speeding through levels like a madman, grabbing anything you can find, and running for the exit. You score points based on the following factors:

1. The base value of the item!
2. How long it's been since the level started! Gems lose score at varying rates depending on the value of the gem--bigger means faster decay. Coins are always worth the same amount, so don't worry about grabbing them too fast.
3. How big your LINK CHAIN is! When your LINK CHAIN ends, you start scoring points based on how long it got! Keep picking stuff up for BIG SCORE! 

To accomplish this, you have a set of super movement techniques available to you:

1. Sliding:
To slide, press and hold the CROUCH key while moving. Sliding reduces your friction, making it easy to build up speed but hard to control your movement.

2. Bunnyhop:
Press the JUMP key while holding a direction, and you'll get a burst of speed in that direction, even while sliding!

3. Pulsar Jump:
Press the FIRE key to shoot a pulsar blast in front of you! Firing a pulsar blast will instantly send you flying backward, at whatever your current speed is. This can be used to launch yourself into the air, quickly change direction, and so on. In addition, the blast itself thrusts you on impact, and does as much damage as a rocket to enemies.

4. Slide Groove:
When you start a slide, you get a brief burst of speed. This can happen once per second. Tapping the slide key at just the right time lets you build lots of speed without leaving the ground.

5. Super Jump:
If you need to get up high, crouch and jump without pressing any movement keys. Combine with a Pulsar Jump off of a wall for even *MORE* height!

6. Vacuum Brake:
Press and hold the ALTFIRE key to slow yourself to a crawl, sucking in nearby coins in the process. Note that this won't suck in gems--you have to pick those up the hard way. Holding this for just over half a second will enable a Vacuum Dash in the direction you're currently facing. You can charge a Vacuum Dash for up to 1 second.

7. Trim Pulse
Press the CROUCH key as you're landing to convert vertical fall speed to forward speed!

# Won't this completely break most maps?

Yes! The goal of this mod is to create a movement-centric experience, as opposed to the combat-centric way most doom mods work. Sure, you might feel that putting the focus on sick jumps over big guns is the opposite of doom-y, and that's all right. I'm not making this thing to be doom-y. I'm making it to be goofy.
