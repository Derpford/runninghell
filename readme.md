# Running Hell
Grab the loot! Dodge the demons! Run like hell!

# Huh? What?
Running Hell is a doom mod about speeding through levels like a madman, grabbing anything you can find, and running for the exit. You score points when you grab an item, based on the following factors:

1. The base value of the item!
2. How long it's been since the level started!
3. How big your LINK CHAIN is! Grabbing a bunch of items in rapid succession creates BIG POINTS!

To accomplish this, you have a set of super movement techniques available to you:

1. Sliding
To slide, press and hold the CROUCH key while moving. Sliding reduces your friction, making it easy to build up speed but hard to control your movement.

2. Boost Jump
Press the JUMP key while holding a direction, and you'll get a burst of speed in that direction, even while sliding!

3. Pulsar Jump
Press the FIRE key to shoot a pulsar blast in front of you! Firing a pulsar blast will push you backward. This can be used to launch yourself into the air.

# Won't this completely break most maps?

Yes! The goal of this mod is to create a movement-centric experience, as opposed to the combat-centric way most doom mods work. Sure, you might feel that putting the focus on sick jumps over big guns is the opposite of doom-y, and that's all right. I'm not making this thing to be doom-y. I'm making it to be goofy.
